<p>
  The KAUST Visualization Lab is hosting an <em>Introduction to Python for Data Science</em> workshop. 
  Visualization lab staff will provide an introduction to Python for data science designed for 
  learners with little or no previous programming experience. Topics covered will include

  <ul>
    <li>Basics of programming in Python</li>
    <li>Basics of Python Data Science libraries including <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, <a href="http://www.numpy.org/ ">Numpy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a></li>
    <li>Next steps for more advanced training in Python for data science.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
      This hands-on lesson is part of the <em>Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series</em> 
      being offered by the KAUST Research Computing Core Labs as part of our on-going efforts to build 
      capacity in core data science skills at KAUST. The workshop curriculum largely follows the 
      <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/">curriculum</a> developed by 
      <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>, a volunteer project dedicated to helping 
      researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research 
      computing skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a live-coding based workshop and learners are expected to bring their own laptops with 
      the required software already downloaded and installed.
